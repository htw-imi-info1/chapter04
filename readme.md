About the Various MusicOrganizer Projects:

* V1 Demonstrates ArrayLists.
* V2 Can also Play Music:
  I've deleted the individual audio subfolders in the original projects and created a common audio folder containing example files from the public domain. You can thus use those filenames in the collection:

      ../audio/Dragonfly-Dash-Berlin.mp3
      ../audio/Storytelling2012.mp3


* V3 demonstrates iterating through the whole collection with for-each. It also has the validIndex method.
* V4 uses a while loop to search for tracks
* V5 improves structure by introducing a track class


the included mp3s are from soundcloud:
